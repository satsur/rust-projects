### 1. Factorial
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).
- **Date Completed**: Tuesday, June 25th, 2024
- **Note**: I accidentally made a fibonacci program before realizing my mistake. This also peaked my interest in number theory, might go down that rabbit hole now.

### 2. Currency Conversion
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which converts a value entered by the user from one currency to another
- **Date Completed**: Tuesday, June 25th, 2024
- **Note**: Also implemented using a struct and HashMap to look up conversion rates, allows for conversion between many different currencies (as long as they are recorded in the HashMap)

### 3. Topdown Triangle
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which uses stars to make a triangle with the most number of stars on the top row and the least (1) on the bottom row. The largest number of stars is entered by the user
- **Date Completed**: Wednesday, June 26th, 2024
- **Note**: Found a cool str function called str::repeat(n: usize) which allows you to repeat a string n times (instead of running the String.push method a bunch of times in a for loop)
