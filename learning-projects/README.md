## Exercises from [whostolemyhat/learning-projects](https://github.com/whostolemyhat/learning-projects/tree/master/1-factorial)

### 1. Factorial
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which finds the factorial of a number entered by the user. (check for all conditions).
- **Date Completed**: Tuesday, June 25th, 2024
- **Note**: I accidentally made a fibonacci program before realizing my mistake. This also peaked my interest in number theory, might go down that rabbit hole now.

### 2. Currency Conversion
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which converts a value entered by the user from one currency to another
- **Date Completed**: Tuesday, June 25th, 2024
- **Note**: Also implemented using a struct and HashMap to look up conversion rates, allows for conversion between many different currencies (as long as they are recorded in the HashMap)

### 3. Topdown Triangle
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which uses stars to make a triangle with the most number of stars on the top row and the least (1) on the bottom row. The largest number of stars is entered by the user
- **Date Completed**: Wednesday, June 26th, 2024
- **Note**: Found a cool str function called str::repeat(n: usize) which allows you to repeat a string n times (instead of running the String.push method a bunch of times in a for loop)

### 4. Bottomup Triangle
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which uses stars to make a triangle with the most number of stars on the bottom row and the least (1) on the top row. The largest number of stars is entered by the user
- **Date Completed**: Wednesday, June 26th, 2024
- **Note**: Basically the same as the topdown triangle program, except the loop is going the other way.

### 5. Odd Triangle
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Write a program which uses stars to make a triangle with the most number of stars on the bottom row and the least (1) on the top row. The number of stars in each row is odd (meaning it is two more than the previous, starting at 1). The largest number of stars is entered by the user. 
- **Date Completed**: Wednesday, June 26th, 2024
- **Note**: Basically the same as the bottomup triangle program, except the loop has a step of 2

### 6. Random Function
- **Difficulty**: Beginner
- **Description**: Call a different function based on the output of a random number generator.
- **Date Completed**: Wednesday, June 26th, 2024
- **Note**: Learned how to generate random numbers.
